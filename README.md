## Css Fontsize Em vs Percent
- ##### The situation is that point and pixel units are not necessarily best suited for web documents, which leaves us with the em and percent units. In theory, both the em and the percent units are identical, but in application, they actually have a few minor differences that are important to consider.
- ##### Em is the up and coming usage. Sometimes it goes against practical applications.
- ##### Percent is the trusted veteran.

## Pro's and Cons of using third party Authentication
#### Pro's:
- ##### Outsource auth handling to OAuth providers.
- ##### Easier to register users no extra form.
- ##### Less passwords for users to remember and you don't have to keep their password secure.

#### Neutral:
- ##### Users need to have a 3rd party account.

#### Cons:
- ##### Users don't trust your site.
- ##### Keep auth scopes minimal.
- ##### Limited/restricted internet access (e.g. if site is offline).
- ##### 2 factor authentication may require own Authentication.
